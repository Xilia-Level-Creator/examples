# Examples of levels in XLA format

A collection of (MIT-licensed) level examples, made with XLA format.
Refer to `xla-spec-latest` for more info about the format
((here)[https://github.com/Xilia-Level-Creator/xla-spec]).

## Short example descriptions

Take a look at the following folders:
 - `minimal-example`: **v1.0.0** -  Simple level of an empty level, can be used
   for testing compiler's ability to unpack XLA files and read metadata.
 - `complex-example`: **v1.0.0** - Fully test compiler's abilities - several
   presets, transforms and patches; custom Lua assets and version flags.
